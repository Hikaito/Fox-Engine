Fox Engine is a program targeted at artists that want a simplified workflow for creating templatized art, such as "adoptables" that are common on forum games. The program composites images that an artist has drawn into new images, a method popularized by early internet doll dressup games and the image creation website [picrew](https://picrew.me/en). This program is distinct from predecessors by the introduction of advanced layer, folder, project, and save features.
